# Project 1. Financial Analytics

* ### Domain: Finance

* ### Difficulty Level: Intermediate

* ### Problem Statement: I am tasked to analyse the market competition for the management of the Fortune top 500 companies in India for Financial Year 2018 to provide better results.

* ### Questions I want to find answers from this analysis:
  
  - Which company has the largest/smallest market share in terms of sales?
  - How does market capitalization correlate with sales figures?
  - Are there any outliers with disproportionately high/low sales for their market cap?
  - What is the average market capitalization and sales in each industry segment?
  - Which companies are showing consistent growth in sales over the quarters?

* ### Tools used:
  - Microsoft Excel - For Initial Data Cleaning (Removing Typographic error)
  - Alteryx - Data Preparation, Join, Analysis
  - Power BI - Data Visualization & Dashboard
  - Google Slides and Canva - Timeline Presentation and Project Report

* ### Methodologies used:
  - Data Profiling
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Wrangling
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Data Visualization
  - Documentation

* ### Data Description:

1. **[Finance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishankmagoo/top-500-companies-in-india) - Data on Fortune 500 Companies in India**

| Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S.No. | integer | NON NULLABLE| Index of the rows |
| Name | string | NON NULLABLE | Name of the Companies |
| Mar Cap - Crore | double | NON NULLABLE | Market Capitalization for each company in Crores |
| Sales Qtr - Crore | double | NON NULLABLE | Quarterly Sales for each company in Crores |

2. **[NIFTY 500 Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhimananubhav/nifty-500-fundamental-statistics) - Data on top 500 companies in India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) based on market capitalisation and average daily turnover.**

| Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| index | integer | NON NULLABLE| Index of the rows |
| company | string | NULLABLE | Name of the Companies |
| industry | string | NULLABLE | Sector of operation |
| symbol | string | NULLABLE | Ticker |
| category | string | NULLABLE| Nifty 50, Nifty Next 50, Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 |
| market_cap | double | NON NULLABLE | Market capitalization in INR Crore |
| current_value | double | NON NULLABLE | Latest stock value |
| high_52week | double | NON NULLABLE | 52 week high |
| low_52week | double | NON NULLABLE| 52 week low |
| book_value | double | NON NULLABLE | Book value |
| price_earnings | double | NON NULLABLE | P/E ratio |
| dividend_yield | double | NON NULLABLE | Dividend yield % |
| roce | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on capital employed % |
| roe | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on equity % |
| sales_growth_3yr | double | NON NULLABLE | Average 3 year sales growth % |

* ### Limitation of the dataset:

1. One major limitation in the dataset provided is that it doesn't contain 500 companies.
2. The market capitalization data varies for the year 2018 in various other datasets containing the fortune 500 Indian companies list.
3. The dataset doesn't include many other quantitative and qualitative columns which limits the insights that could have been generated.
4. 'Sales Qtr - Crore' column is ambiguous.

To address the third issue, I used another external dataset names 'NIFTY 500' from Kaggle which I used to add the sector for each of these companies.

* ### Metrics to measure:

1. **Market Share**: It is the percentage of total sales in an industry generated by a particular company. It gives a general idea of the size of a company in relation to its market and competitors.

       Market Share = Company's Quarterly Sales/Total Quarterly Sales of All Companies * 100

2. **Sales Growth Rate**: This measures the rate at which a business is able to increase revenue from sales during a fixed period of time.

       Sales Growth Rate = (Current Quarter Sales - Previous Quarter Sales)/Previous Quarter Sales *100
   
4. **Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S)**: This is a valuation ratio that compares a company’s stock price to its revenues. It indicates the value that financial markets have placed on each dollar of a company’s sales or revenues.

       P/S Ratio = Market Capitalization/Total Sales

5. **Sales per Capita**: This is a measure of the average sales amount per person (or per head) in a certain group, such as the number of salespeople in a company.

       Sales per Capita = Quarterly Sales/Market Capitalization
  
* ### Data Cleaning:

* ### Data Exploration: Explore the data to understand its characteristics and patterns. This involves using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.
  
* ### Data Analysis: Perform the actual analysis based on the project’s objective. This could involve statistical analysis, machine learning, data mining, etc.
  
* ### Interpretation of Results: Interpret the results of the analysis. Try to understand what the results mean in the context of the project’s objective.
  
* ### Reporting: Prepare a report or a presentation to communicate the findings of the analysis. The report should be clear and concise, and it should be tailored to the audience’s level of expertise.

### Limitations of the project:

# Project 2. Budget Sales Analytics

* ### Domain: Retail & Sales

* ### Difficulty Level: Advanced

* ### Problem Statement:
Our "Domain Sale" process is structured to help potential buyers purchase the domain they want immediately without the hassle of contacting the seller directly. A seller lists a domain for sale at a specific price in our Marketplace. An interested buyer sees this domain for sale and decides to buy it.
Extract various information such as Sales, budget, and variance. You can even compare sales and budgets with various attributes. Extract necessary information about Products and Customers. Make the necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data. Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard. Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes
