# Project 1. Financial Analytics

* ### Domain: Finance

* ### Difficulty Level: Intermediate

* ### Problem Statement: I am tasked to analyse the market competition for the management of the Fortune top 500 companies in India for Financial Year 2018 to provide better results.

* ### Tools used:
  - Microsoft Excel - For Initial Data Cleaning (Removing Typographic error)
  - Alteryx - Data Preparation, Join, Analysis
  - Power BI - Data Visualization & Dashboard
  - Google Slides and Canva - Timeline Presentation and Project Report

* ### Methodologies used:
  - Data Profiling
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Wrangling
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Data Visualization
  - Documentation

* ### Data Description:

1. **[Finance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishankmagoo/top-500-companies-in-india) - Data on Fortune 500 Companies in India**

| Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S.No. | integer | NON NULLABLE| Index of the rows |
| Name | string | NON NULLABLE | Name of the Companies |
| Mar Cap - Crore | double | NON NULLABLE | Market Capitalization for each company in Crores |
| Sales Qtr - Crore | double | NON NULLABLE | Quarterly Sales for each company in Crores |

2. **[NIFTY 500 Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhimananubhav/nifty-500-fundamental-statistics) - Data on top 500 companies in India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) based on market capitalisation and average daily turnover.**

| Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| index | integer | NON NULLABLE| Index of the rows |
| company | string | NULLABLE | Name of the Companies |
| industry | string | NULLABLE | Sector of operation |
| symbol | string | NULLABLE | Ticker |
| category | string | NULLABLE| Nifty 50, Nifty Next 50, Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 |
| market_cap | double | NON NULLABLE | Market capitalization in INR Crore |
| current_value | double | NON NULLABLE | Latest stock value |
| high_52week | double | NON NULLABLE | 52 week high |
| low_52week | double | NON NULLABLE| 52 week low |
| book_value | double | NON NULLABLE | Book value |
| price_earnings | double | NON NULLABLE | P/E ratio |
| dividend_yield | double | NON NULLABLE | Dividend yield % |
| roce | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on capital employed % |
| roe | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on equity % |
| sales_growth_3yr | double | NON NULLABLE | Average 3 year sales growth % |

* ### Limitation of the dataset:

1. One major limitation in the dataset provided is that it doesn't contain 500 companies.
2. The market capitalization data varies for the year 2018 in various other datasets containing the fortune 500 Indian companies list.
3. The dataset doesn't include many other quantitative and qualitative columns which limits the insights that could have been generated.
4. 'Sales Qtr - Crore' column is ambiguous.

To address the third issue, I used another external dataset names 'NIFTY 500' from Kaggle which I used to add the sector for each of these companies.

* ### Metrics to measure:

1. **Market Share**: It is the percentage of total sales in an industry generated by a particular company. It gives a general idea of the size of a company in relation to its market and competitors.

       Market Share = Company's Quarterly Sales/Total Quarterly Sales of All Companies * 100

2. **Sales Yield**:  In finance, yield is the prospective return on an investment.

       Sales per Capita = Quarterly Sales/Market Capitalization
  
* ### Data Cleaning:

   I used Microsoft Excel and Alteryx for cleaning and transforming the data. In this phase I removed duplicate entries, corrected typographical errors, joined column from external dataset, organized the data by sorting and filtering, created numerical and categorical columns based on existing one. I've documented all the changes here in this [Changelog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDhmjGJxXsieriydLpLRMFHGMSKQQsCbhuTJqJbyLkw/edit?usp=sharing).

  After cleaning and transforming the dataset, I end up with this dataset -

  | Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | Rank | integer | NON NULLABLE | Ranking based on Market Capitalization for each company |
  | CompanyID | integer | NON NULLABLE | Unique id for each company |
  | Company Name | string | NON NULLABLE | Name of the Company |
  | Market Capitalization (in Crore) | double | NON NULLABLE | Market Capitalization for each company in Crores INR |
  | Quarterly Sales (in Crore) | double | NON NULLABLE | Quarterly Sales for each company in Crores INR |
  | industry | string | NON NULLABLE | Sector of operation |
  | Market Share | double | NON NULLABLE | % of total sales generated |
  | Sales Yield | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on Investment |
  | Category | string | NON NULLABLE | Category based on Market Cap(Small, Mid, Large) |

* ### Data Exploration:

  I explored the data to understand its characteristics and patterns using Alteryx and Microsoft Power BI. It involved using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques. Here I want to find answers to questions such as -

# Project 2. Budget Sales Analytics

* ### Domain: Retail & Sales

* ### Difficulty Level: Advanced

* ### Problem Statement:
Our "Domain Sale" process is structured to help potential buyers purchase the domain they want immediately without the hassle of contacting the seller directly. A seller lists a domain for sale at a specific price in our Marketplace. An interested buyer sees this domain for sale and decides to buy it.
Extract various information such as Sales, budget, and variance. You can even compare sales and budgets with various attributes. Extract necessary information about Products and Customers. Make the necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data. Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard. Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes
