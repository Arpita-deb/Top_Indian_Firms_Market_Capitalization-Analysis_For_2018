## Data Description:

1. **[Finance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishankmagoo/top-500-companies-in-india) - Data on Fortune 500 Companies in India**

| Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S.No. | integer | NON NULLABLE| Index of the rows |
| Name | string | NON NULLABLE | Name of the Companies |
| Mar Cap - Crore | double | NON NULLABLE | Market Capitalization for each company in Crores |
| Sales Qtr - Crore | double | NON NULLABLE | Quarterly Sales for each company in Crores |

2. **[NIFTY 500 Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhimananubhav/nifty-500-fundamental-statistics) - Data on top 500 companies in India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) based on market capitalisation and average daily turnover.**

| Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| index | integer | NON NULLABLE| Index of the rows |
| company | string | NULLABLE | Name of the Companies |
| industry | string | NULLABLE | Sector of operation |
| symbol | string | NULLABLE | Ticker |
| category | string | NULLABLE| Nifty 50, Nifty Next 50, Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 |
| market_cap | double | NON NULLABLE | Market capitalization in INR Crore |
| current_value | double | NON NULLABLE | Latest stock value |
| high_52week | double | NON NULLABLE | 52 week high |
| low_52week | double | NON NULLABLE| 52 week low |
| book_value | double | NON NULLABLE | Book value |
| price_earnings | double | NON NULLABLE | P/E ratio |

| roce | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on capital employed % |
| roe | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on equity % |
| sales_growth_3yr | double | NON NULLABLE | Average 3 year sales growth % |

## Limitation of the dataset:

1. One major limitation in the dataset provided is that it doesn't contain 500 companies.
2. The market capitalization data varies for the year 2018 in various other datasets containing the fortune 500 Indian companies list.
3. The dataset doesn't include many other quantitative and qualitative columns which limits the insights that could have been generated.
4. 'Sales Qtr - Crore' column is ambiguous.

To address the third issue, I used another external dataset names 'NIFTY 500' from Kaggle which I used to add the sector for each of these companies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure:

1. **Market Capitalization**: Market capitalization, often referred to as "market cap," is the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock.
	
       Market Capitalization = Price Per Share × Shares Outstanding

2. **Quarterly Sales**: Quarterly revenue growth measures the increase in a firm's sales from one quarter to another.


3. **Rank**: Rank of a company based on their total market cap in 2018. This is calculated by Sorting the companies by Market Cap in descending order and indexing them starting from 1. So the company with highest market cap will rank 1, the second highest 2 and so on.


4. **Market Share**: It is the percentage of total sales in an industry generated by a particular company. It gives a general idea of the size of a company in relation to its market and competitors.

       Market Share = Company's Quarterly Sales/Total Quarterly Sales of All Companies * 100

5. **Sales Yield**:  In finance, yield is the prospective return on an investment.

       Sales per Capita = Quarterly Sales/Market Capitalization
  
## Data Cleaning:

   I used Microsoft Excel and Alteryx for cleaning and transforming the data. In this phase I removed duplicate entries, corrected typographical errors, joined column from external dataset, organized the data by sorting and filtering, created numerical and categorical columns based on existing one. I've documented all the changes here in this [Changelog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDhmjGJxXsieriydLpLRMFHGMSKQQsCbhuTJqJbyLkw/edit?usp=sharing).

  After cleaning and transforming the dataset, we end up with 9 columns and 487 rows -

  | Column name | Datatype | Type | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | Rank | integer | NON NULLABLE | Ranking based on Market Capitalization for each company |
  | CompanyID | integer | NON NULLABLE | Unique id for each company |
  | Company Name | string | NON NULLABLE | Name of the Company |
  | Market Capitalization (in Crore) | double | NON NULLABLE | Market Capitalization for each company in Crores INR |
  | Quarterly Sales (in Crore) | double | NON NULLABLE | Quarterly Sales for each company in Crores INR |
  | Industry | string | NON NULLABLE | Sector of operation |
  | Market Share | double | NON NULLABLE | % of total sales generated |
  | Sales Yield | double | NON NULLABLE | Return on Investment |
  | Category | string | NON NULLABLE | Category based on Market Cap(Small, Mid, Large) |

## Data Exploration:

  I explored the data to understand its characteristics and patterns using Alteryx and Microsoft Power BI. It involved using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques. Here I want to find answers to questions such as -

* **Summary of Exploratory Data Analysis:**

1. The analysis reveals outliers in Quarterly Sales and Market Capitalization among 487 companies. The median market cap is ₹28,784 crore, with the highest at ₹5,83,436 crore, indicating significant variance. The top three companies by market cap in 2018 were Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, and HDFC Bank, holding market shares of 32.85%, 31.74%, and 27.19%, respectively.

2. The IT, Energy, and Automobile sectors led in Average Market Capitalization, while the Energy, Metals, and Automobile sectors topped Average Quarterly Sales. Notable outliers included Reliance Industries from Energy and Tata Consultancy Services from IT.

3. Market capitalization correlated moderately with sales, with a coefficient of 0.5868. Companies were classified into large (market cap > ₹28,000 crore), mid (market cap between ₹8,000 crore and ₹28,000 crore), and small (market cap < ₹8,000 crore) categories, with small caps being the majority.

4. A scatterplot comparing Quarterly Sales and Market Cap ranks showed minimal positive correlation, with only 31 companies ranking under 50 in both categories. This gets more complicated as we've ranked the companies in descending order of their market cap and sales, which means companies ranking higher in market cap (i.e. closer to 1) also have a higher sales rank (i.e. closer to 1). This means that as the rank of a company by market cap increases there tends to be a tendency for its rank by quarterly sales to also increase. However, correlation does not imply causation. This means that while there is a relationship between market cap ranks and quarterly sales ranks, it doesn't necessarily mean that one directly causes another. Other factors could influence both market cap and sales independently.
   
5. This exploratory analysis suggests a potential industry link to market cap, which we'll verify by doing a hypothesis testing.

## Data Analysis:

**Hypothesis Testing**



  
## Interpretation of Results:

  Interpret the results of the analysis. Try to understand what the results mean in the context of the project’s objective.
  
## Reporting:
  Prepare a report or a presentation to communicate the findings of the analysis. The report should be clear and concise, and it should be tailored to the audience’s level of expertise.

## Limitations of the project:

1. The dataset was incomplete with only 488 rows with 1 duplicate entry instead of 500.
2. The data did not contain other numeric columns such as Revenue, Quarterly sales for different quarters, Market cap from previous years etc which could have allowed us to perform more advanced analysis such as Sales Efficiency Analysis, Growth Analysis, Correlation and Regression Analysis, Predictive Analysis etc.

## Future Ideas:

1. In order to analyze competition among companies one can collect these data -

   1. Market Research Data including information about industries,market trends, customer preferences and demographics.
   2. Financial statement such as income, balance sheets, cash flow statements to provide insights into a company's profitability, liquidity and financial health.
   3. Market Share Data within specific sector or region.
   4. details about products and services offered by each competitor, including pricing strategies, product features and customer value propositions.
   5. Customer data including customer behavior, satisfaction levels and loyalty.
   6. Marketing and sales strategies, distribution campaigns, sales tactics and promotional activities to understand how competitors attract and retain customers. 

2. Compare various metrics such as revenue, profit margins, return on investment (ROI), debt levels across competitors to reveal strengths and weaknesses.

3. Perform more advanced data analysis techniques e.g., -
   1. Correlation Analysis - to help undestand relation between two or more variables.
   2. Regression Analysis - to predict one or more independent variables (e.g., pricing, promotion efforts) on a dependent variable (e.g., sales revenue, market share etc).
   3. Cluster Analysis - to group competitors based on similar attributes such as market segments, product features or customer demographics.
   4. Trend Analysis - to assess sales growth rates, market share changes etc to identify emerging trends and opportunities.
   5. SWOT Analysis -  to systematically evaluate internal and external factors affecting competitiveness.
